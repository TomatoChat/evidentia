Based on the Convex documentation, here's a comprehensive to-do list for integrating Convex with your Evidentia Flask backend and planning the migration:

## To-Do List for Convex Integration & Migration

### 1. Initial Convex Setup
- [ ] Create a Convex account at [convex.dev](https://docs.convex.dev/home)
- [ ] Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
- [ ] Initialize Convex in your project: `npx convex dev`
- [ ] Set up your Convex deployment and get the deployment URL

### 2. Schema Design & Migration Planning

Based on your Evidentia brand research tool, you'll need to store:

**Core Data Structures:**
- [ ] **User Sessions**
  - `session_id` (string, UUID)
  - `email` (string)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `last_active` (timestamp)

- [ ] **Brand Analysis Results**
  - `session_id` (reference to user session)
  - `brand_name` (string)
  - `brand_description` (text)
  - `competitors` (array of strings)
  - `analysis_timestamp` (timestamp)
  - `status` (enum: pending, completed, failed)

- [ ] **GEO Analysis Data**
  - `session_id` (reference)
  - `search_queries` (array of strings)
  - `optimization_suggestions` (text)
  - `progress_status` (number, 0-100)
  - `completed_at` (timestamp)

- [ ] **Report History**
  - `session_id` (reference)
  - `report_type` (string: brand_analysis, geo_analysis)
  - `report_data` (JSON object)
  - `email_sent` (boolean)
  - `generated_at` (timestamp)

### 3. Convex Schema Definition
- [ ] Create `convex/schema.ts` file with your data models
- [ ] Define tables for: `sessions`, `brand_analyses`, `geo_analyses`, `reports`
- [ ] Set up proper indexes for efficient querying

### 4. Convex Functions Development
- [ ] **Mutations** (write operations):
  - `createSession.ts` - Create new user session
  - `saveBrandAnalysis.ts` - Store brand analysis results
  - `saveGeoAnalysis.ts` - Store GEO analysis results
  - `updateProgress.ts` - Update analysis progress

- [ ] **Queries** (read operations):
  - `getSession.ts` - Retrieve session data
  - `getBrandAnalysis.ts` - Get brand analysis by session
  - `getGeoAnalysis.ts` - Get GEO analysis by session
  - `getReportHistory.ts` - Get user's report history

### 5. Flask Backend Integration
- [ ] Update Flask routes to use Convex Python client
- [ ] Replace current session management with Convex storage
- [ ] Modify analysis endpoints to save results to Convex
- [ ] Update progress streaming to read from Convex

### 6. Migration Strategy
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Set up Convex alongside existing system
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Migrate session management first
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Migrate analysis result storage
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Add real-time features using Convex subscriptions
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Remove old storage mechanisms

### 7. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Add Convex deployment URL to your `.env` file
- [ ] Update Flask app configuration to include Convex client
- [ ] Set up proper error handling for Convex operations

### 8. Real-time Features (Convex Advantage)
- [ ] Implement real-time progress updates using Convex subscriptions
- [ ] Add live status updates for analysis completion
- [ ] Consider real-time collaboration features for future

### 9. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test data persistence across sessions
- [ ] Validate real-time updates work correctly
- [ ] Ensure email functionality integrates with new storage
- [ ] Performance testing with Convex queries

### 10. Deployment Considerations
- [ ] Set up Convex production deployment
- [ ] Configure proper authentication if needed
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Plan for data backup and recovery

## Key Benefits You'll Gain:
- **Real-time updates**: Progress can be truly live without manual streaming
- **TypeScript safety**: Schema validation and type safety
- **Scalability**: Convex handles scaling automatically
- **Reactive queries**: UI can automatically update when data changes
- **Better data consistency**: ACID transactions built-in
