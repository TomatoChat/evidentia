## 📈 Optimization Recommendations

1. **🎯 Increase Content Marketing**: Create more content around workflow automation for Italian SMBs
2. **🔍 SEO & GEO Strategy**: Optimize for queries about "Italian business automation" and "workflow tools Italy"
3. **📝 Case Studies**: Develop Italian customer success stories and implementation guides
4. **🤝 Partnerships**: Consider partnerships with Italian business organizations
5. **🌍 Local Presence**: Strengthen Italian market presence and localization
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **"No module named 'libs'"** - Make sure `PROJECT_DIRECTORY` is set correctly in `.env`
2. **OpenAI API errors** - Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. **Permission errors** - Ensure the virtual environment is activated
4. **Port already in use** - The server runs on port 5000 by default
