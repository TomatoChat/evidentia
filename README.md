**Traditional SEO** focuses on optimizing for search engine rankings (Google, Bing, etc.)
**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** focuses on optimizing for AI assistant responses (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

This tool helps you understand and improve your **GEO performance** - how your brand appears when users ask AI assistants for recommendations, comparisons, or information.

## Troubleshooting

1. **"No module named 'libs'"** - Make sure `PROJECT_DIRECTORY` is set correctly in `.env`
2. **OpenAI API errors** - Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. **Permission errors** - Ensure the virtual environment is activated
4. **Port already in use** - The server runs on port 5000 by default
