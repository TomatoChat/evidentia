## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Key Missing**: Clear error messages with setup instructions
- **Rate Limiting**: Graceful degradation with retry logic
- **Network Issues**: Fallback responses with error context
- **Invalid Responses**: JSON parsing protection with error reporting

## Best Practices

### 1. **API Key Security**
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management
- Rotate keys regularly

### 2. **Cost Management**
- Monitor API usage through Perplexity dashboard
- Implement caching for repeated queries
- Use appropriate query complexity

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Consider response time vs. data freshness trade-offs
- Implement async processing for long-running analyses
- Cache results when appropriate

### 4. **Error Recovery**
- Implement fallback to OpenAI when Perplexity fails
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY environment variable is not set`**
```bash
# Solution: Set your API key
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**2. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'`**
```bash
# Solution: Install requests
pip install requests
```

**3. API Rate Limiting**
- Check your Perplexity account usage limits
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Consider upgrading your Perplexity plan

**4. JSON Parsing Errors**
- Usually caused by API response format changes
- Check logs for raw response content
- Verify API key permissions

## Support

For issues specific to this integration:
1. Check the example file: `backend/examples/perplexity_example.py`
2. Review server logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify API key permissions in Perplexity dashboard
4. Test with simple queries first before complex brand analysis
