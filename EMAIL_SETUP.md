- **Full JSON Report** as attachment
- **Professional HTML Design** with Evidentia branding
- **Plain Text Fallback** for email clients that don't support HTML

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Double-check your email and app password
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled for Gmail
   - Use app password, not your regular password

2. **"SMTP server not found"**
   - Verify the SMTP server address
   - Check if your network blocks SMTP ports

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Some networks block outgoing SMTP traffic
   - Try using a different network or VPN

4. **Email not received**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify the recipient email is correct
   - Check server logs for error messages

### Debug Mode
The server will print email status to the console:
- ‚úÖ "Report successfully sent to email@example.com"
- ‚ùå "Failed to send email: [error details]"

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use app passwords instead of regular passwords
- Consider using environment variables in production
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
